# Workshop

This repository holds the majority of my personal learning process, It has no purpose, other that save it, it has folder for each of the stuff I currently am learning, and it probably don't follow any good pattern.

Although I do have some programming experience, I skipped some many things, and missed so many important concepts, that I decided to start all over again, so, I discarded all the stuff I've made in the past, and went back to the basics, I hope I don't regret! The thing I am new to is `web-development` I have no experience on that field, so is repo is filled up with mostly web-stuff.

## The stuff

Learning is a long process, it takes time and effort, it sometimes can get messy, so, I've decided to organize this repo in this way:

The `master` brach will contain only finished courses, books, or complete tutorials, in-progress stuff will be committed to an individual branch, until they get finished.

### Finished Courses

When a course gets finished, it will be listed here.

The following programming languages, frameworks and/or technologies can be found in their respective branch:

- C
- Rust
- Web development
  - The odin project
  - Full stack web development
  - React course

## Math

> It is impossible to be a mathematician without being a poet in soul.

I also do math-related programming, however, that code is kept on a separated repository, you probably can see the code [on this repository](https://github.com/skrapyrobot/mathness).

## The garage

[The garage repository](https://github.com/skrapyrobot/garage) contains mostly bad code I type for the sake of it, it has no use, and probably doesn't work, it's my personal workshop, I save that stuff just in case.
