# Rust

I am planning make rust my default system programming, so I'm heavily focusing on it, as soon as I finish the C part.

The progress on this one, even when they are multiple resources, will be saved on the same branch

## My rust approach

This is a little bit different, to other courses and/or books taken in this repo, it consists on multiple books read at the same time, and an interactive thing called [Rustlings](#rustlings) (spoiler: it is amazing).

### Rust book

Following [rust's book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) as the main method to learn rust, is supposed to be the "the way to go", so I'm dong so...

- [x] Chap 01
- [ ] Chap 02

### Rust by example

This part is a little bit more interactive, it's all about writing programs, and all the technical stuff is leaved to the book

Here is my progress so far

- [x] Chap 01
- [ ] Chap 02

### Rustlings

Kinda my favorite part of learning! Here on [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) we don't write new programs, we fix code, and it is amazing!

## Rating

Not enough progress, but I like it

## Project

if any project gets too big to place it here, or requires its own repo, it will be listed here
