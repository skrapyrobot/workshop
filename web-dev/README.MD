# The odin project

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is a community based-course, so to speak, that has great resources to learn programming, includes videos, and nice written articles and I am enjoying it quite a lot... I hope I can continue to learn and grow using it!

## Progression

The Odin project has two main section, the second is divided in two paths, `full stack react` and `full stack ruby on rails`, I however, have chosen the first, `full stack with react`, here is my progression so far.

### Foundations

The beginner part

- [x] Introduction
- [x] Prerequisites
- [x] Git basics
- [x] HTML Foundations
- [x] CSS Foundations
- [x] Flexbox
- [ ] JavaScript basics

### Full stack JavaScript

Yes, yes, yes the path has `JavaScript` on its title but I actually am using `TypeScript` because it is better and simpler, and batter, so, I only have to catch up with the `js` part while typing `ts`, that will be fun, I guess...

## Rating

So far, I'll give it a solid 5/5

## Projects

This course has some projects, if I consider it necessary, they are going to be hosted on a separated, public repository

The Following are projects that has been published independently:
