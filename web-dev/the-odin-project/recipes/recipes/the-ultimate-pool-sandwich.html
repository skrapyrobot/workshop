            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                When I was a kid, we often spent all day at the community pool.
                We’d leisurely snack on popsicles and chips, until it was time
                for lunch. No one wanted to dry off, get dressed, and go home
                for lunch. Mayonnaise didn’t travel well and wasn’t safe under
                the summer sun. Peanut butter sandwiches were a solution, but
                also suffered under the heat.
            </p>
            <p>
                My kids love the pool too, so I looked for a better alternative
                to those less-than lunches of childhood. The answer? Stuffed
                sandwiches. They travel well and are easy to eat, even with wet
                pool fingers. Prepping the night before or in the morning is
                easy with a round loaf filled with sandwich fixings. A bake-on
                mustard and butter coating adds extra flavor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ingredients are easy; you can make this sandwich from
                whatever deli meats and cheeses you have on hand. Kid hands can
                also help in the process. Simply make or buy a round unsliced
                bread loaf, cut off the top, scoop out the insides, and fill.
                The completed round sandwich stores well in the fridge
                overnight. Slice it ahead and put it in zip-top bags. Or, keep
                it in the circular form and wrap the entire sandwich for slicing
                and serving poolside.
            </p>
            <h2>ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 round bread loaf</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
                <li>1/2 pound sliced deli ham</li>
                <li>1/2 pound sliced deli turkey</li>
                <li>6 slices Swiss cheese</li>
                <li>6 slices Cheddar or Colby Jack cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And now, the real deal:</p>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>
                    Cut a wide circle out of the bread loaf top like you’re
                    making a soup bread bowl. Carefully remove and set aside the
                    loaf top.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hollow out the bread interior, being careful not to break
                    through the sides. The loaf interior can be used to make
                    croutons, so there’s no waste.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Melt butter with mustard in the microwave for 15 seconds in
                    a small bowl. Mix well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Brush butter mixture onto the exterior of the bread loaf and
                    top; place loaf and top on a baking sheet.
                </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Let cool.</li>
                <li>
                    Pat lettuce dry and place a layer in the bottom of the
                    hollowed-out loaf. Layer cheese over lettuce. Add a layer of
                    ham and turkey. Repeat until the loaf is full. Top with
                    reserved bread top.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wrap sandwich in plastic wrap and put on a baking sheet.
                    Place another baking sheet on top with something to weigh it
                    down.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the completed sandwich on the baking sheet in the
                    refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep the sandwich whole or cut it into easy triangular
                    sections.
                </li>
            </ol>
